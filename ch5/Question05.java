	 * 	n & (n-1) == 0 is used to check whether n is a power of 2 or not.
	 * For example, let's take n = 8.
	 * n = 1000
	 * n-1 = 0111
	 * It is clear that n & n-1 share no bit set in the same place. Therefore, their product will be zero.
	 * 
	 * For example, n=16
	 * n = 10000
	 * n-1 = 01111
	 * n & (n-1) = 00000
	 * 
	 * This type of configuration is possible only for powers of 2. For all other numbers, n & n-1 will not be zero.
