	 A chess board has 32 black squares and 32 white.
	 If the two corners of the board are cut, they should be of the same color.
	 This will leave us with either 30 black and 32 white squares or the other way round.
	 
	 A domino will cover 1W and 1B square. There are 31 of them. But there will be 30 W/B squares depending on the case.
	 So, it is impossible.
