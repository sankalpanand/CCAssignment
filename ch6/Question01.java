	 Take 20 pills from 20th bottle.
	 
	 Expected weight if each of them were same-
	 1 + 2 + 3 + .... + 20 = (20 * 21)/2 = 210
	 
	 In the present scenario, it will be more than 210, like 211.9 gm.
	 Here, substract 210 from it to get 1.9 gram. Then divide it by 0.1 to get 19.
	 19th bottle contributed to the over weight.
