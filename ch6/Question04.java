	 Ants will not collide when they all move in the same direction.
	 All 3 ants moving in the same direction is (1/2)^3
	 Therefore, P(clockwise) =  (1/2)^3
	 and, P(counter clockwise) =  (1/2)^3
	 
	 P(same direction) = P(clockwise) + P(counter clockwise) = 2 * (1/2)^3 = 1/4
	 P(collision) = 1 - P(same direction) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4
	 
	 FOLLOW UP: For a n sided polygon
	 P(collision) = 1 - P(same direction) = 1 - 2 * (1/2)^n = 1 - (1/2)^(n-1)
