	 Step 1: Divide 1000 bottles in batches of 100, 100 each. Test them and wait for 7 days.
	 Step 2: Only one batch will have the poisoned. And we will now have 9 strips left. Divide it into 12 groups each. Test them and wait for 7 days. 
	 Step 3: Now we will be left with one batch of 12 bottles, 8 strips and 1 poisoned bottle. Divide them into batches of 2 and run tests.
	 Step 4: Now you have narrowed down to two bottles with enough strips left. Run tests again and you will find out.
	 
	 So, total 7 * 4 = 28 days.
