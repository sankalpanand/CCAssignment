	 Case 1: If there is only 1 blue eyed person, he can look around for people and can notice that everyone is green eyed.
	 Having the knowledge that there is only one blue eyed person, he can conclude that its him. He can take the flight.
	 It will take just one flight in this case.
	 
	 Case 2: When they will encounter each other, both can conclude that it is not the case of just 1 blue eyed person. 
	 If it were the case, he would have left the previous night. So, each one of them can understand that he is also a blue eyed person.
	 In this case it will take 2 flights.
	 
	 Case 3: When 3 such persons are there, they know that if there are just 2 persons with blue eyes, they would have left the previous night.
	 So, they can conclude that each of them are blue eyed and can leave from 3rd flight.
	 In this case it will take 3 flights.
	 
	 Case n: When we generalize, it will take n flights.
